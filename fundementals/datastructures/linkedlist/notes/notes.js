/**
 * linked lists like differ from arrays such that every element in it's structure is formed, well, like a link. So one element has a reference to the next (singly linked list)
 * a doubly linked list has the reference to the next element and the one before it, and a circular linked list is the same as the singly, but the last element has a reference
 * to the first element.
 * 
 * The big difference is that with linked list it's faster to get the beginning of an arary, take it off or instert an element infront, while arrays it's faster to get random
 * elements within the data structure.
